When I was just a kid, Mom used to take me and my sister out for bubble tea on Saturdays after she got home from her morning shift. It was something I looked forward to every week. I’d open the doors wide and see all my friends, and sometimes, the shop owner would even have my favorite order ready! It was the one time and place we knew we could come be where all the homework and chores of the outside world couldn’t keep us down.

I remember the old shopkeeper used to ask every customer how they were, and you could tell he really meant it. And we all answered honestly. We may have lived in a pretty large city, but in that shop, we were a tiny, tight-knit community. I always told him I was gonna open a shop just like his one day.

Intro Cutscene

After college, real life hit me like a bag full of taxes. I got a desk job in a small town out East. I made rent. I had always dreamed of opening a tea shop, but it was just that: a dream.

That changed two months ago. I got a letter in the mail from the son of someone I had known as a kid. He… had passed. His son had found an old Polaroid of us together. 

(Polaroid says: “Can’t wait to try your tea someday!”)

Eventually, you have to stop dreaming and start chasing. That’s the thought that brought me all the way back to the city.That’s the thought that’s kept me going over the past two months of crafting and construction. But it’s finally ready- my own shop. I got this.


[Player Name]: Whew…..

[Player Name]: Okay.

[Player Name]: Okay.

[Player Name]: I can do this! I can do this. Just… Unlock the door.

[Player Name]: Aaaaaaand

[Player Name]: Boop!

(The door opens. [Player Name] walks into their new shop as morning sunlight streams through the open windows, illuminating a cozy but un-lived-in space)

[Player Name]: Alright. Opening procedures. Let’s see.

[Player Name]: I’ve gotta double check all the machines and turn them on, get the food counter prepped, and then I’ll do my extra secret final step.

(Player interacts with machines and bakery counter, has time to walk around and explore. When done, stand by the cash register)

[Player Name]: Looking good, shop!

[Player Name]: Looking good, [Player Name]!

[Player Name]: Haha. So glad nobody is here to see that.

[Player Name], imitating shop: They’ll never understand our friendship!

[Player Name]: Okay okay seriously though, quiet down! I think I spy our first customer!

[Player Name]: Time for my super secret final prep step.

NIKKI walks through the front door, which gives a pleasant jingling

[Player Name]: WELCOME TO [Player Name], I’M POSITIVITEA

[Player Name]: Wait

[Player Name]: oh god I screwed up already oh god oh no

NIKKI: Well, hi!

NIKKI: Welcome to Nikki, I’m (Town Name)!

NIKKI: But seriously, A+ for enthusiasm. This shop is so cute!

[Player Name]: Uh, thank you! 

[Player Name]: I designed all the decorations myself. I want you all to feel right at home in my shop!

NIKKI: Well, you’re on the right track, that’s for sure, haha

NIKKI: …

NIKKI: So.

NIKKI: To Business.
[Player Name]: (She got so serious all of a sudden???)

NIKKI: Tell me.

[Player Name]: (Eep!)

NIKKI: …

NIKKI: Can I get a large Thai tea, please?

[Player Name]: (ohthankgodshejustwantstea)

[Player Name]: Of COURSE, what kind of a boba shop would I be without it?

[Player Name]: What would you like in it? We’ve got your standard tapioca balls and a bunch of fun, fruity stuff, too.

NIKKI: Oh, I like to keep it classic. Hit me up with that tapioca, dude!

[Player Name]: BET. Be right back, feel free to make yourself at home until then!

Player is prompted to use the machines to make a THAI TEA. NIKKI sits in the middle of the room and opens a book. Player eventually finishes making tea and is prompted to place it at the pickup counter.

[Player Name]: Uhh, order for Nikki!

NIKKI: …

[Player Name]: …

[Player Name]: Helloooo?

[Player Name]: She’s totally absorbed in that book. Nobody’s here, I’ll just bring it to her.

Player is prompted to pick up the tea and OPEN THE COUNTER, then bring the drink to NIKKI

[Player Name]: Here you go!

NIKKI: Oh!

NIKKI: Sorry, I totally zoned in. Thank you so much!

NIKKI takes a fucking sip, babes.

NIKKI: Oh.

NIKKI: Oh my god.

[Player Name]: (oh god she hates it)

NIKKI: Oh god I love it!

[Player Name]: Wait, really?

NIKKI: I don’t mean to brag, but I’m something of a thai tea connoisseur. And this?

NIKKI: This is mint.

[Player Name]: No it’s not, it’s tea.

[Player Name]: I don’t know why I said that. Thank you, that means a lot!

[Player Name]: Let me know if you need anything else!

[Player Name]: (Off to a great start! Hopefully she’ll tell her friends, and then we’ll be in business!)

[Player Name]: (In the meantime, looks like Walter, Beauregard, and Refrigerator Johnson could use some love.)

Player is prompted to pick up the watering can and interact with the three plants on the shelf.

[Player Name]: (On second thought, maybe I should rename them?)

Player is prompted to rename the plants.

[Player Name]: Nice.

Nikki: What?

[Player Name]: Nothing! Hah!

[Player Name]: (Back to the counter for me!)

[Player Name]: (And just in time!)

Two more random NPCs enter the shop. A final tutorial prompt explains that the player can exit the counter and walk around the shop at any time when there are no customers in line.

Grant

Intro
GRANT: So, this is the place that’s been under the construction tarp for so long.

GRANT: Heck of a job!

[Player Name]: Thank you! I’m trying my best! This shop’s always been a dream of mine, so it was important to me to nail the hashtag vibe, know what I mean?

GRANT: Hah! Ironic irl hashtag. I love it.

GRANT: Real quick question, what y’all got that ISN’T chock full of caffeine?

[Player Name]: Weeeeell…

GRANT: No worries, I know that’s like. Most of your shop. I’m sure it’s all super tasty too! Just, uh, don’t agree with the ol’ tum-tum super well.

[Player Name]: (TMI, dude...) 

[Player Name]: Gotcha! Well, you’re definitely gonna wanna avoid the tiramisu.

GRANT: You mean the cake laced in coffee? Whaaaat?

[Player Name]: Ahaha. Ok for real though? The smoothies are probably your best bet. All fresh fruit!

GRANT: Okay, I can get behind a smoothie!

GRANT: Hmmmmm.

GRANT: Whaddya think then, [Player Name], Red Bean or Mango?

Mango Route
[Player Name]: Oh, it’s gotta be Mango, dude. They’re in season right now and the flavor is KILLER.

GRANT: Oh dang, you got a good mango hookup?

[Player Name]: I’LL NEVER REVEAL MY SECRETS! NEVER!

[Player Name]:...

GRANT:...

[Player Name]: But I will absolutely sell you a smoothie. 

GRANT: I’ll crack you one day. You’ll let it slip when you’re not thinking.

GRANT: But in the meantime, yeah, can I get a small?

[Player Name]: Absolutely! Normal tapioca balls okay?

GRANT: Yes Sir/Ma’am/, Please!

[Player Name]: Coming right up!

Red Bean Route
[Player Name]: For you, I’m thinking something more earthy. Let’s do Red Bean!

GRANT: Heck yeah, I’m down!

GRANT: That wasn’t really a flavor that was available where I lived, so I’m always excited to get it.

[Player Name]: Oh dang, must not have been around here, then.

GRANT: Nope!

GRANT: We’re a long way from Texas, Toto!
GRANT: …

GRANT: Yeah, that didn’t really land. Anyway.

GRANT: It’s gotta be tapioca balls if we’re doing red bean! Let me get that in a small, please!

[Player Name]: You got it, ~pardner~!

GRANT: …

[Player Name]: No?

[Player Name]: … I’ll have it right out sorry

GRANT: Thanks!

GRANT: Pardner.

[Player Name]: (!!!)

[Player Name]: You got it!
Variant 2

GRANT: [Player Name]! I need my fix, dude!
Variant 3
Lobby Conversation 1
GRANt: [I told them, a custom solution makes no sense!]

GRANT: [With their budget and staffing, something out of box is way more maintainable!]

GRANT: Oop, hi [Player Name]!

GRANT: Was a bit zoned out there.

GRANT: What’s up!

[Player Name]: Oh, I’m just making the rounds.

[Player Name]: The shop’s kind of slow right now, so I figured I’d get to know my customers a little.

[Player Name]: I’m super new in town, so I figured, what better place to make friends?

GRANT: You know, I’m not gonna lie, most places this would be kinda weird.

GRANT: But I dunno, [Player Name], something about you and this shop makes it feel genuine.

GRANT: So, hi!

GRANT: Nice to meet you without a counter in the way!

[Player Name]: Nice to meet you!

Player is prompted to ask questions about the NPC


Where are you from?

[Player Name]: Your accent’s got a really nice little twang to it. If you don’t mind me asking, where ya from, bud?

GRANT: Oh yeah!

GRANT: I’m from down South.

GRANT: You know, yee haw and stuff

GRANT: Is it really that noticeable?

[Player Name]: I mean not really?

[Player Name]: You just don’t sound like a beach bum, haha

GRANT: You can take the cow out of the boy

GRANT: But you can’t take the boy out of the cow

GRANT: …

GRANT: That’s not how that goes.

[Player Name]: Noooo…

GRANT: But you get what I mean, right?

[Player Name]: Kinda?

[Player Name]: Like, you can’t completely erase where you’re from

[Player Name]: And who would want to, honestly?

[Player Name]: That’s part of what makes you, you!

GRANT: Yeah exactly!

GRANT: Gotta say, this fox misses them some barbecue.

GRANT: Just ain’t the same here.

GRANT: Plenty of other good stuff in trade though, like super friendly boba shop owners

GRANT: Whoooo give people free drinks?

[Player Name]: Don’t push it

[Player Name]: Haha

GRANT: Hehe

GRANT: It was worth a shot!

[Player Name]: So what brings you this far out West?

GRANT: Oh, you know

GRANT: A bunch of things! Lots of work out here for a developer consultant. Nice, casual atmosphere.

GRANT: I just reeeeally wanted to spend all my money on rent, you know?

[Player Name]: Hah, same

GRANT: But really, I think I just needed a change of pace. Maybe I’ll go back someday.

GRANT: But right now, this is really working for me. I was starting to think about moving back, but

[Player Name]: But?

GRANT: Then I tried your tea! 

GRANT: And everyone in the shop is so nice.

GRANT: I feel like I’ve maybe got neighbors I like now!


What do you do?

[Player Name]: I see you on that big fancy looking businessy phone a lot

[Player Name]: What exactly are ya doing?

[Player Name]: Spooky government work?

GRANT: I could tell you, but I’d literally have to kill you.

[Player Name]:...

[Player Name]: (He’s joking right)

GRANT: I’m totally joking

[Player Name]: (I have GOT to get better at reading sarcasm)

GRANT: I’m just a software consultant haha

[Player Name]:...

[Player Name]: I’m not gonna lie I don’t know what that means

GRANT: Honestly me neither sometimes!

GRANT: Mostly people pay me and sometimes I make apps

GRANT: But sometimes I tell them how to make apps

GRANT: P much it.

GRANT: Not the most interesting thing in the world, but it definitely pays the bills.

GRANT: What were you doin’ before you started the best tea shop on this side of the beach, eh?

[Player Name]: I was a public accountant, if you can believe it.

GRANT: Oh god, that’s so many numbers!

GRANT: And no tapioca!

[Player Name]: Haha yeah

[Player Name]: No digs on accountants, but this suits me way better.

GRANT: Well, I’m sure as heck glad you made the jump.

GRANT: Shoot, maybe I will someday, too.

[Player Name]: Oh?

[Player Name]: What would you rather do?

GRANT: You know, I think writing video games would be really fun.

[Player Name]: Have you ever tried it?

GRANT: Nah, but I will someday!

GRANT: If you can take the leap, I can, too!

[Player Name]: That’s the spirit!

How’s it going?

GRANT: Honestly?

GRANT: Things are looking up!

GRANT: I kind of had a difficult year, but you gotta power through things, you know?

GRANT: The more I started actually engaging with the people around me, the less alone I felt.

GRANT: Ain’t it strange, [Player Name]? If you just reach out a little, it turns out the strangers around you were a little community just waitin’ for you to join.

[Player Name]: You know, I’m definitely beginning to feel that here.


Nikki

NIKKI: Hello again, [Player Name]!

NIKKI: You remembered!

Lobby Conversation 1

[Player Name]: Hi Nikki, watcha reading?

NIKKI: Eep!

NIKKI: How are you so quiet? You’d think it’d be harder to sneak up on me with ears like this, but you seem to manage!

[Player Name]: I’m sorry!

[Player Name]: Didn’t mean to startle you!

NIKKI: No, don’t worry about it, haha

NIKKI: I just get really engrossed in stuff.

NIKKI: I’m actually reading over my own manuscript!

NIKKI: Or like,

NIKKI: The chapter and a half I’ve managed to write

[Player Name]: Oh, you’re a novelist?

NIKKI: Can I say yes if I haven’t finished a book?

[Player Name]: You wanna do it, right?

NIKKI: Well, yeah.

[Player Name]: And you’re taking steps to do it?

NIKKI: I am, yeah!

[Player Name]: Then you are ABSOLUTELY a novelist!

NIKKI: …

NIKKI: You know, I hadn’t thought of it like that.

NIKKI: That… actually helps my confidence a lot!

NIKKI: I know we just met a little while ago, but you’re a really good friend, [Player Name]!

NIKKI: What did you need again?

[Player Name]: I’m just trying to get to know everyone!

Player is prompted to ask questions about the NPC
 
What’s your book about?

[Player Name]: You said you were writing a book, right?

[Player Name]: Am I allowed to ask what it’s about?

NIKKI: Ohohoho boy

NIKKI: Are you sure you wanna go down that rabbit hole?

NIKKI: I could talk for hours.

[Player Name]: Well, I don’t have HOURS…

[Player Name]: But I do absolutely wanna hear about it

[Player Name]: Can you give me a synopsis?

[Player Name]: A little summarino?

NIKKI: Summarino?

[Player Name]: Yeah, I knew when I said it that it was nothing. You know what I mean.

NIKKI: Haha

NIKKI: Okay so

NIKKI: Have you heard of 

Where are you from?

[Player Name]: You seem really familiar with the area, Nikki.

[Player Name]: Have you lived here awhile?

NIKKI: Oh, kinda?

NIKKI: I grew up in a suburb a city over, so I've kinda been AROUND here my whole life, I guess?

NIKKI: Here-adjacent.

NIKKI: Or something.

NIKKI: I’ve visited other places, sure, but this is where home is for me.

NIKKI: The weather is wonderful, and everybody in town is so welcoming and friendly.

NIKKI: Just like you, [Player Name]! You fit right into our little community like a part we didn’t know we were missing.

[Player Name]: (!!!)

NIKKI: How about you, [Player Name]? Where was home before home was here?

[Player Name]: Oh, nowhere super interesting, honestly.

NIKKI: It doesn’t have to be all that interesting for me to be interested!

NIKKI: It’s always nice to know your friends’ stories, after all.

NIKKI: If nothing else, so I can steal them from you and use them in a book!

[Player Name]: You know, that’s fair.

[Player Name]: I grew up in the Midwest, so, like I said, nothing super exciting.

[Player Name]: Mild summers, snowy winters, and lots of flat land.

[Player Name]: So, nothing like here!

[Player Name]: I had a nice, cushy little ‘safe’ job, and some decent savings.

[Player Name]: It was fine, ‘till somebody reminded me of how bad I used to want a shop like this as a kid.

NIKKI: Oh man.

NIKKI: So you just like

NIKKI: Up and left?

[Player Name]: Pretty much, yeah.

[Player Name]: Probably a little reckless, I know.

NIKKI: You know, maybe

NIKKI: But what’s worse, you know?

NIKKI: You could have played it safe, but you would have always wondered what would have happened if you hadn’t.

NIKKI: And I’m so freakin’ glad you did!

NIKKI: I’m gonna make sure to tell everyone about this place.

[Player Name]: Ahhh, you’re too much!

How are you?

[Player Name]: How are you today, Nikki?

NIKKI: You know what?

NIKKI: I was doing pretty well already.

NIKKI: But having someone genuinely ask about you always brightens my day.

NIKKI: So now I’m doing great!

[Player Name]: And I keep wondering, why did I keep to myself for so long?

SIERRA: Oh, I totally know what you mean, though.

SIERRA: I’m not exactly the most outgoing person in the world, but my shop forced me to get out of my comfort zone a little.

Player is prompted to ask questions about the NPC

What’s the story behind your shop?

[Player Name]: So Sierra, how long have you been running your shop?

SIERRA: Oh man, the time blows by, [Player Name]

SIERRA: Let’s see.

SIERRA: I wanna saaaaay

SIERRA: Around 5 years?

SIERRA: I was working part time at a home goods store to pay for school

SIERRA: And one day, I was watching the owner and thought, you know what? I could do that.

SIERRA: I managed to get a pretty solid loan, paid it off quick, and the rest is history!

SIERRA: It turns out, lots of people love plants just as much as me!

[Player Name]: I’m sure it helps that you love them so much yourself!

[Player Name]: That kind of enthusiasm is downright infectious.

SIERRA: Oh I absolutely think so!

SIERRA: Your shop is the same way, you know?

SIERRA: You can feel in every detail how much you love this place.

SIERRA: And it makes it really easy for me to love it too!

Where are you from?

[Player Name]: Have you always lived around here?

SIERRA: Nahhh

SIERRA: I moved here for school and just never left

SIERRA I’m from like,

SIERRA: The actually cool part of the south?

SIERRA: With nice people and good food and stuff.

SIERRA:But the summers are stupid hot, you know?

SIERRA: I kinda melt when it gets that toasty.

[Player Name]: I definitely getcha.

[Player Name]: Anywhere that it’s not enough to cook an egg on a car?

[Player Name]: That is NOT a place for [Player Name].

[Player Name]: Well, I’m glad you’re here!

[Player Name]: My shop wouldn’t be the same without your plants.

[Player Name]: Or your lil bunny face!

SIERRA: !!!

How are you?

[Player Name]: How ya hangin’?

SIERRA: Well, now that you mention it, I think the caffeine is starting to wear off a bit

SIERRA: I can’t smell colors anymore.

SIERRA: Which is probably a good thing!

[Player Name]: I’ll be honest, I didn’t really expect to need a cutoff policy at my boba shop

[Player Name]: Ma’am, you’ve had enough!

SIERRA: Aahahaha

SIERRA: Ma’am! Put the tapioca down!

SIERRA: I’m gonna have to take your keys!

SAL: Anyway, I landed a work visa and I’ve been on the road ever since!

[Player Name]: Oh man, everyone back home must miss the heck out of you!

SAL: Oh for sure.

SAL: But I’m sure your folks back wherever you’re from miss you, too!

[Player Name]: Yeah, but they know I’m out following my dreams and stuff, so it’s cool.

SAL: Exactly! I’ll see them again one day. And until then, every new friend I make makes a city into a new home, you know?

SAL: I like to find little shops like this and be a part of the communities that grow up around them.

SAL: This is already one of my favorites.

How are you?

[Player Name]: How are you doing, Mr. Music Man?

SAL: I’m alright!

SAL: My bank account’s looked better, but hey, nobody said it’d be easy.

SAL: I’ll make it big one of these days.

SAL: But in the meantime, I don’t mind going gig to gig. As long as people are enjoying my music, I don’t need a lot.
