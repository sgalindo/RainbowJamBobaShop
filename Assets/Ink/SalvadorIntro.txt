[Player Name]: Welcome to Positivitea, what can I get you?

Sal: Oop, one sec, your menu isn’t on Maps yet and I haven’t had time to rehearse my order

Sal: Uhhhh

Sal: A Thai Tea?

Sal: No Wait. I came in here because I was hungry OOPS

[Player Name]: We’ve got snacks too!

Sal: Yes I can see!

Sal: I love all the macaron colors!

[Player Name]: Thank you! I think they taste just as bright as they look!

Sal: Well, I’m sold!

Sal: Oh wait

Sal: That tiramisu looks incredible, too…

Sal: Oh geez

* [Macarons!]

    [Player Name]: I think I’d try the Macaron if I were you! The tiramisu is great too, but if you’re unsure, you can’t beat the pure sweetness of a macaron. 

    Sal: You know what? You’re right!

    Sal: I’m into it.

    Sal: You ever notice how people who make travelling part of their personality get so uppity about foods like macarons?

    [Player Name]: Ahaha, right??

    [Player Name]: Ohoho, Papa paid for me to study in Paaariiiis.

    Sal: Hah!

    Sal: Have you ever been to Paaaariiiiis?

    Sal: You haaaave to go. It was life changing.

    Sal: You haven’t had proper macaron unless you’ve had them in Paaariiiis.

    [Player Name]: Hah! Alright Count Reginald von Moneybags,

    [Player Name]: How many do you want?

    Sal: Can I get one of each color, please?

    [Player Name]: Say no more! I’ll have a fat stack out to you in just a sec.

    Sal: Thank you!

* [Tiramisu!]

    [Player Name]: Macaron can be a little sweet if that’s not exactly what you want. How about a slice of Tiramisu?

    Sal: You know what, you’re right! Hook me up with some of those coffee soaked bad boys.

    [Player Name]: Ladyfingers for DAYS, son!

    Sal: Ah yes, some ladyfingers for a post-luncheon dessert.

    [Player Name]: Induuuubitably

    [Player Name]: Haha

    [Player Name]: Such a snooty name for such a basic lil cookie

    [Player Name]: Lemme get you a slice, just a sec.

    Sal: Thanks so much!
