[Player Name]: Alright. Opening procedures. Let’s see.

[Player Name]: I’ve gotta double check all the machines and turn them on, get the food counter prepped, and then I’ll do my extra secret final step.

(Player interacts with machines and bakery counter, has time to walk around and explore. When done, stand by the cash register)

[Player Name]: Looking good, shop!

[Player Name]: Looking good, [Player Name]!

[Player Name]: Haha. So glad nobody is here to see that.

[Player Name], imitating shop: They’ll never understand our friendship!

[Player Name]: Okay okay seriously though, quiet down! I think I spy our first customer!

[Player Name]: Time for my super secret final prep step.
